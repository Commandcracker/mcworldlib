- Make AnvilRegion.load() store compressed NBT and return NBT decompressing on-the-fly,
  to allow it to be nbtlib-agnostic
- Fully support MCC files
- Custom Dimensions
- *Pos*() constructor should accept a single iterable in constructor, like tuple()
	- Currently Pos(1, 2) is OK, Pos(pos) is not, and vice-versa for tuple()
	- Method signatures that take a Pos must either be:
		- Pos.method(otherpos), inconsistent with constructor, or
		- Pos.method(*otherpos), forcing an un-natural unpacking
	- Can't (trivially) override typing.NamedTuple.__new__
- typing.NamedTuple can't be (trivially) subclassed
	- dataclasses also do not accept single iterable in constructor, and are not isinstance(tuple)
	- No other is as fast as NamedTuple: https://death.andgravity.com/namedtuples
