- Other NBT .dat files: World.data, for the "data/" dir, advancements, playerdata
- JSON data
- Easy, path-like way to locate and print an NBT data in World
	- see walk_nbt() and extend it to all World filesystem
	- @property subpath, relative to parent, for all classes:
		- Level: path.stem() [always "level.dat"]
		- Dimension: path.relative_to(world.path)
		- Regions: category
		- Region: path.stem()
		- Chunk: "chunk.{cx}.{cz}"
- Custom Dimensions
	- Convert Dimension to a full-fledged class
	- Overworld, Nether and The End are singleton instances
- Decouple Anvil/Regions and NBT parsing Library
	- AnvilRegion.load() store compressed NBT and return NBT decompressing on-the-fly,
	  fully agnostic about NBT content
- Dirty control. Possible strategies:
	- Manual control, user sets chunk.changed = True (Amulet approach)
	- Custom __setitem__/__delitem__ on Compound and List to auto-set dirty
	- Serializing+Hashing content to detect changes:
		- serialize and hash Root on parse(), keep result, do it again on write() and compare
		- serializing must be *MUCH* faster than write(), otherwise just compare binary NBT
		- hashes: md5, python's hash()
		- serializations: JSON, Pickle, walk, str/repr(sorted(dict.items())), msgpack

- Fully support MCC files
- *Pos*() constructor should accept a single iterable in constructor, like tuple()
	- Currently Pos(1, 2) is OK, Pos(pos) is not, and vice-versa for tuple()
	- Method signatures that take a Pos must either be:
		- Pos.method(otherpos), inconsistent with constructor, or
		- Pos.method(*otherpos), forcing an un-natural unpacking
	- Can't (trivially) override typing.NamedTuple.__new__, or subclass it
	- dataclasses also do not accept single iterable in constructor, and are not isinstance(tuple)
	- No other is as fast as NamedTuple: https://death.andgravity.com/namedtuples
